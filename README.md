# Smart-Irrigation-System


I’m excited to share a hands-on project I’ve been working on – a Smart Irrigation System designed to optimize water usage in agriculture using IoT technology.

🔧 Key Features:
🌡️ DHT11 Sensor for Temperature & Humidity monitoring
🌾 Soil Moisture Sensor to detect dryness
🌧️ Rain Sensor to avoid unnecessary watering
🚶 PIR Motion Sensor for field activity detection
⚡ Relay-controlled Water Pump Automation
🔊 Buzzer Alert System for motion/rain warning
🛠️ All components are connected and programmed using Arduino C/C++, and tested successfully on hardware.

📊 The system intelligently:
Waters only when soil is dry and there's no rain
Alerts if rain is detected or motion is observed
Logs real-time data via Serial Monitor for debugging

This project is a small step towards smart agriculture and sustainable water management, especially useful in rural or semi-urban farming environments.
💡 Future Scope:
Cloud integration for remote monitoring
Android app for farmer alerts and control
Solar-powered version for off-grid areas
